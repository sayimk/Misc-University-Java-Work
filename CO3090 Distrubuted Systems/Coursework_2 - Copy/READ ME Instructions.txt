my code was tested on Ubuntu 16 64-bit and was written and tested on Windows 10 64-bit

To Start RMI Registry
1. Navigate to Query-Server folder
2. Navigate to the Bin folder
3. Start RMI Registry

To run the Server:
1. Navigate to Query-Server folder
2. Navigate to src folder
3. run java client.QueryServer

To run the Client:
1. Navigate to the QueryClient folder
2. Navigate to the src folder
3. run java client.QueryClient {File to be Queried} {Query1} {Query 2}

NOTE: files to query are HousesPrices.csv and CarFuel.csv

NOTE: this RMI Server and Client do NOT USE Codebase as this is a localhost example, thus RMIRegistry must be executed in the BIN Folder

NOTE: only the location of the Security.policy file is auto-set during server execution and will be set to Query-Server/src/Security.policy

NOTE: to query date and price in CarFuel, date must be Query1 and price must be Query 2

NOTE: to query dates in HousesPrices use - e.g 2017- , 11-
